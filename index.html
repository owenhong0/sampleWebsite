    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>My name is Owen and I am a third year computer science and business administration major
        concentrating in finance. I grew up in Southborough, MA and I did not go far to attend
        Northeastern University. My professional experiences include a prior co-op as a full stack
        software engineering intern at Big Hat Biosciences and my next co-op will be the same. 
        My passion lies in cooking, playing the guitar, hiking, and baking bread. Some sports that
        I have done in the past involve Muy Thai, alpine slalom skiing, badminton, and ultimate
        frisbee but I mostly hike now while going to the gym. This image is a dish that I made
        recently called Thai Red Duck Curry that goes with either rice or bread. The inspiration
        for this dish came from a craving that I had in having curry during cold weather and I
        just so happened to have the means to obtain duck. Foraging around Quincy, I was able
        to get the necessary ingredients and, in a matter of a few hours, churn this out. Itâ€™s
        simple to make, however, the hardest part will be trying to get all the ingredients.
        The lime leaves are especially tricky to find here.
